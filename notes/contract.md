# Consulting Agreement and Fee Proposal

Below I have set out a description of services that I will provide, along with a fee proposal.

## Project:
Under this consulting agreement, Nicholas Grundl (“Consultant”) will render the following services to Aepnus Technology (“Client”) as Client may from time-to-time request. Consultant will provide insights on the electrochemical separation and/or production of various products through the implementation and modification of a techno-economic model and analysis thereof.

**In particular, Consultant will prioritize the following items:**
- Comparative evaluation of a sodium sulfate processing facility across multiple electrolysis technologies, including bipolar electrode, membrane electrode, and next-generation Aepnus electrode systems.
- Comparative evaluation of a sodium sulfate processing facility using non-electrolysis technologies (e.g., crystallization to solid and subsequent disposal).
- Understanding the impacts of product requirements (e.g., NaOH wt%, H2SO4 wt%).
- Understanding the impacts of market volatility on costs (e.g., NaOH price, electricity price, precious metal price).
- Reporting and visualization of the above to internal and external stakeholders (e.g., scientists, investors, executives).

It is understood that the implementation of the above is open-ended and may evolve over time as research and technology advances. As such, specific initial deliverables should include:

1. Addition of a membrane electrolysis (ME) process to the existing model.
2. Addition of NaOH and H2SO4 concentration to a specified target wt% to the existing model.
3. Addition of a crystallization plus disposal process to the existing model.
4. Updating the electrolysis cost model based on recent publications (e.g., NREL 2024).
5. Updating sensitivity analysis to explore electrolysis-specific parameters.

## Schedule of Work:
The initial work will commence on 05/20/2024, with initial analysis results provided no later than 06/27/2024.

## Fees and Reimbursement:
Cash fee: $150 per hour. Consultant shall update Client bi-weekly (or as requested) with services and expenses charged and planned work timelines. Additionally, Consultant will provide reasonable receipts or other documentation of expenses as Client might request, including copies of time records.

If you agree that the foregoing fairly sets out your understanding of our mutual responsibilities, please sign and return a copy of this letter to me.
